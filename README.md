# Assignment13

- Make a Tab navigation for the app (no need to log in)
- The Tabs should be: home, search and profile
- Set up Apollo Client (with Authentication logic) to be able to log the user in.
- When the user goes to profile the user should see a login form.
- After the user logs in, show the profile of the user.
- The goal is to be able to use the app even if we are logged out, to see coffees shops, but if we log in, we can see our profile.
